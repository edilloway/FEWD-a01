FEWD assignment 1
## About me
Hi, my name is Elyse. I have a degree in Paleontology but I am going back to school for web development. I've had the opportunity to work in retail, as a curator at a museum, and even as an animal caregiver for the humane society. Those all didn't work out for their own reasons, but everything in my life keeps coming back to computers. I decided to just go with what I love and finally study web development and computer science. Programming can be really challenging, but I like the fact that you always have to solve a new problem. Besides FEWD, in my free time, I enjoy video games, art, and watching movies. Wow, that sounds really boring, but I'm not sure what else to write. It's just what I like to do in my free time. 

I might as well include a link to my instagram. I'll launch an online shop... hopefully soon. I'm still trying to come up with a cohesive brand identity, which is turning out to be more challenging than I thought. I like that we also learned about design and user experience in this class; it's been helpful in the process!
